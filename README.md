Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze stock market trends to identify potential profit-making opportunities. Using historical stock price data, we aim to provide insights into market behavior, calculate profits based on hypothetical trades, and offer visualizations for better decision-making.

Summary of Results
Profit Analysis:
The project successfully calculates potential profits based on buying and selling strategies derived from historical stock price data.
Visualizations:
Graphs showing trends in stock prices, moving averages, and potential buy/sell points provide actionable insights.
Performance Metrics:
Results indicate a [insert specific result, e.g., "15% profit margin on selected trades over 6 months"].
Challenges Faced
Data Retrieval Issues: Limited data availability for some stocks or date ranges.
Algorithm Optimization: Developing efficient algorithms for analyzing large datasets was challenging.
Market Volatility: Capturing trends in highly volatile stocks required additional smoothing techniques.
Future Scope
